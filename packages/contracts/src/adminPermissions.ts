/**
 * What a bot admin is allowed to do, one key per thing the code actually gates.
 *
 * Deliberately short. A permission that no branch reads is a promise the panel
 * makes and nothing keeps — the admin ticks a box, believes an operator has been
 * restricted, and the operator carries on. So this list grows only when a
 * `can()` call is added beside the entry, never in advance.
 *
 * `admins.permissions` is `jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'` and has been since
 * `0005_ops.sql`; no migration adds it. An empty object means "whatever this
 * role has always meant", which is what every existing row holds.
