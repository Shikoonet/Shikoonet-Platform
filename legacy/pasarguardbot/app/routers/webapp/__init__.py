"""
WebApp router package for handling Telegram WebApp endpoints and browser login.

Split by feature so new endpoints can be added in their own small module
instead of growing one large file:
  - auth: login, OTP, session, logout, web-account management
  - services: service list/detail, config links, clients, link/sub change
  - usage_chart: per-service usage chart
  - renew: manual renewal options + confirm
  - buy: new purchase flow (delegates to WebAppPurchaseService)
  - balance: balance top-up methods and deposit flows
  - transactions: unified payment transaction history
  - upgrade: extend-time / extra-volume purchases and config transfer
  - state: shared in-memory auth state (OTP sessions, revoked tokens, locks)
